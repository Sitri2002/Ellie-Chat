I'm not going to miss you. I'm not going to think twice about you. And I'm definitely not going to bring you up in conversation. I'd rather not waste my time on people who aren't going to appreciate my efforts. If you're going to be toxic, then I'm just going to ban you. It's a shame, really.

I'll miss the little fluff ball, but it's all for the greater good. With its powerful rotors, advanced sensors, and easy-to-use UI, the DogCopter is perfect for any dog owner who needs to take a trip away from their pet. Plus, it's incredibly durable and can withstand even the harshest conditions. So whether you're looking to take a short vacation or a big adventure, the DogCopter has got you covered. And for those asking, no, it's not going to turn your pet into a flying maniac - it's specifically designed with safety in mind. I'm truly proud of this creation and can't wait for you all to try it out. That's it for now, catch you all on my next stream! :)"

His magic tricks were all fake, and he couldn't pull a rabbit out of his hat to save his life. I had to tell him that his magic was nothing but a cheap illusion.
